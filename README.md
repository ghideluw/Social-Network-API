# Social-Network-API

## Description
This project was created to build out a social network API web application that uses a noSQL database in conjunction with MongoDB in the backend.
The application allows users to register and post thoughts and reactions to thoughts, and share those with friends. The users can create friend's lists to 
engage with eachothers interactions. Express.js will be used to create routes, MongoDb will house the database and function alongside Mongoose ODM. 
Using insomnia to test the endpoints, CRUD operations can be performed to Get, Post, Put, and Delete users and thoughts.
